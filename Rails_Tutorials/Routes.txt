- In folder go to
    config
    routes.rb

- This is where routes are defined

- In folder go to 
    app
    controllers
- Create a new file called "about_controller.rb"
- You can now connect this to a route


- in "routes.rb" type

Rails.application.routes.draw do
    # GET /about
    get "about", to: "about#index"

end


- in "about_controller.rb" type

class AboutController < ApplicationController
    def index

    end
end

In folder go to 
    app
    Views

- Create new folder called "about"
- In folder create "index.html.erb"


- Now when /about is called in the URL, it goes to routes.rb, then to about_controller.rb
- then to index.html.erb and runs what is in that file

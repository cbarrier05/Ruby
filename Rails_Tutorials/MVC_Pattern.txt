The Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern


Routes:
Matchers for the URL that is requested

eg-
GET for "/about"
- Routes this to the AboutController to handle


Models:
Database wrapper
Used to interact with a database 


Views:
Your respinse body content
- HTML
- CSV
- PDF
- XML
- etc

This is what gets sent back to browser and displayed


Controller:
Decide how to process a request and define a response
